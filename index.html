        <h3>Waterproofing</h3>
         <p>If you’ve never had any waterproofing done to your outdoor deck, it pays to get it done as soon as possible. The longer you wait, the more difficult the job becomes and the higher the possability of wood rot or concrete deterioration. In some cases, it could mean complete deck replacement. It’s going to require a professional who has the right waterproofing knowledge, systems and tools.</p>

        <img src="img/productsPlidekPool.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The PLI-DEK™ waterproof deck system for plywood substrates has been ICC-ES evaluated since 1980. The system utilizes a 2.5 galvanized metal lath and a polyacrylic emulsion base coat, with a wide variety of finish options. All of the systems carry a One-Hour and Class A Fire Rating. When installed, the system is approximately 3/16 inch thick and less than 3 lbs. per square foot, therefore alleviating additional framing expenses. The systems have been through extensive ASTM testing, as well as many years of applications in the field, therefore has proven its durability and quality.</p>

        <img src="img/productsAirBarrier1.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Uncontrolled air leakage through the building envelope will affect the performance of the building materials within the wall assembly. Air/Weather Barriers (AWB) control the unintended movement of air and moisture into and out of a building enclosure. Air/Weather Barrier systems are comprised of a number of materials which are assembled together to provide a complete barrier to air and water leakage through the building envelope.</p>
